          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>I  am blessed to have had the opportunity to experience these collections of trips highlighted below. Each has given me unique life experiences that I will treasure for all of my days. I can honestly say that I would not be the same person if not for these experiences from my life. I learned how to be independent. I emerged in different cultures at a young age. I connected with nature in a way I could've never in the city and fortified relationships near to my heart to this day.</p>

          <p>Since I was six years old, surfing has been a part of my life. There is no place I would rather be than out in the ocean with my family and friends enjoying nature. It has become an escape from the day-to-day work I do for the university and internships, but this does not mean I'm not learning. Most importantly, surfing has taught me focus and patience. In surfing, one wrong move can result in highly damaging results. Being focused and paying attention to detail is extremely important in surfing and the workplace.</p>
          <p>Similarly, not having patience while surfing can also have damaging results. No one is a good surfer when they start, and surfing is all about the resilience to keep moving forward even when the odds are stacked against you.</p>

          <p>I was extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to travel through Europe with my older brother, cousin, and aunt when I was twelve and thirteen years old. Under the strict guidance of my aunt, we spent the majority of our time outside of the soccer games, going to museums and taking in the culture/heritage of all cities/countries we visited. During the soccer games, though, only my brother, cousin, and I remained. Experiencing those games with them and having the responsibility of that level of independence gave me newfound confidence and personal growth. Confidence and growth that is apparent to this day.</p>
