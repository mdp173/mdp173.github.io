        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article id="home-intro-words">
          <p>I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to experience these collections of trips highlighted below. Each has given me unique life experiences that will be treasured for all of my days. I can honestly say that I would not be the same person if these experiences were deleted from my life. I learned how to be independent, I was emerged in different cultures at a young age, I connected with nature in a way I could've never in the city, and fortied relationships that are near to my heart till this day.</p>

        <a href="extreme_sports.html"<h3>Collection of Surf Trips</h3></a>
        <p>Surfing has been a part of my life since I was six years old. There is no place I rather be than out in the ocean with my family and friends enjoying nature. It has become an escape from the day-to-day work I do for the univeristy and internships, but this does not mean I'm not learning. Most importantly, surfing has taught me focus and patience. In surfing, one wrong move can result in extremely demaging results. Being focused and paying attention to detail is not only extremely important in the workplace, but also in surfing. Similarly, not having patience while surfing can also have damaging results. No-one is a good surfer when they start. Surfing is all about the resilience to keep moving forward even when the odds are stacked agaist you.</p>

        <a href="soccer.html"<h3>Collection of Soccer Trips</h3></a>
        <p>I was extremely fortunated to have had the opportunity to travel through Europe with my older brother, cousin, and aunt when I was twelve and thirteen years old. Under the strict guidance on my aunt, spent the majority of our time outside of the soccer games going to musems and taking in the culture/heritige of all cities/countries we visited. During the soccer games though, it was only my brother, my cousin, and I. Experiecing those games with them and having the responsability of that level of independance gave me new found confidence and personal growth. Confidence and growth that is apparent till this day.</p>
