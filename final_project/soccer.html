          <h2>The Bonds That Build Us</h2>
          <p>I will forever be grateful to my aunt for organizing this collection of soccer trips and giving my brother, cousin, and me the opportunity to be independent early. This trip developed my independence, but it also fortified the bonds with my family members, which is something I will treasure for all my days. There are stories from this trip that are still told whenever we see each other. It is easy to say that I became a man on these trips. I experienced different cultures and had to learn how to take care of myself, and I was taught life lessons I follow to this day. My love for traveling grew because of these soccer trips, and the lessons learned while on the trips have only positively affected my personal/professional life.</p>

          <h3>The First Trip</h3>
          <p>Year: <time datetime="2011">2011</time></p>
          <p>I was only twelve years old when we went on our first soccer trip. This trip was heavily focused, not only on soccer but also on the culture/heritage of the places we visited. For example, we went to the Picasso museum in Madrid or saw the Eiffel Tower in Paris. It was exciting for a twelve-year-old to be exposed to so much culture. These are memories I still treasure. This first trip was a turning point because I was no longer treated like a child, and I loved it. I matured past my age mentally and emotionally in this first trip, where I started to picture my life in the future and how I wanted to give my children the same experiences I had. This first trip made me work harder for what I wanted when I got back, and it gave me a sense of urgency to make something out of my life for the first time.</p>

          <h3>The Second Trip</h3>
          <p>Year: <time datetime="2012">2012</time></p>
          <p>The following year, I was thirteen, and we decided to repeat the trip. However, the trip was focused on the soccer games and less on culture this time. This new focus was terrific because I wanted as much independence and freedom as possible now that I was a little older. I wanted to experience Europe with my brother and cousin, and I was learning with them along the way and having the time of our lives. Being just us three in the games grew our bond to extreme levels, and these are relationships that I value highly in my life today. Most importantly, I am grateful for these trips because I spent them with my family in an environment that we all loved. Building those connections and expanding my cultural horizons are extremely valuable to my personal/professional life to this day.</p>
