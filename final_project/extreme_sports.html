          <h2>Owing it all to Surfing</h2>
          <p>I have always felt a special connection to surfing and the ocean. From it putting a smile on my face when I was only six to challenging me to keep improving even six-teen years later. Not only has surfing given me a connection to nature, but it has fortified the bond that I have with my father because we get to surf together to this day. I do not know what kind of personality I would have if it weren't for surfing. Growing up, I was an agitated kid, and surfing found a way to calm me down. I will keep surfing near my heart for the rest of my days, and I look forward to seeing how my work life will be positively affected by surfing, like the rest of my experiences have. </p>

          <h2>The First Trip</h2>
          <p>Year: <time datetime="2007">2007</time></p>
          <p>At only nine years old, I went on my first real surf trip. We would stay on a boat for two weeks surfing around the atolls of the Maldives. I was so scared. The coral reef, the intimidating waves, and being so young were all factors that kept me up at night. This trip is one of my favorite memories because of the fear I overcame and the fantastic time we had. This trip is where I was introduced to high-level risk-taking, and it gave me the confidence to believe that I could achieve anything I set my sights on. Confidence that I display to this day because of surfing allows me to be a risk-taker even when others are hesitant. </p>

          <h2>The Best Trip</h2>
          <p>Year: <time datetime="2019">2019</time></p>
          <p>My best surf trip was a couple of years ago when I was twenty years old. This time, I was accompanied by my whole family, and we stayed in a surf resort in one of the atolls in the Maldives. This surf trip boosted my confidence in surfing and my personal life to an all-time high. The pressure of potential injury on the coral reef and being completely focused on performing the way I wanted was what I needed to take my abilities to the next level. Not only my abilities but the mental fortitude necessary to assume these risks associated with surfing. Overall, surfing has made me a stronger individual mentally, emotionally, and physically. These are qualities that will benefit me in my professional and personal life.</P>
