    <h1>My Name is Marcos de Azevedo Paiva</h1>

    <p>Where do I start? I am 22 years old, turing 23 on September 15th.
      I am originally from SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil, but I've lived outside of
      the country for so long that I consider myself an international soul.
      I am currently a senior at the University of Miami persuing my BBA in
      Business Analytics. Looking ahead of college, I am not sure what I will
      do yet. I might stay here in the United States if the opportunity
      presents itself, but my heart is telling me to go back home to Brasil.
      My goal with this page is to put myself out there and tell people my
      story.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <p>I am a man of many interests. Ranging from extreme sports, to sleeping,
      and card games. In this section, I will tell you a little more about
      my two most important interests that have shaped who I am today.</p>

    <p>The most influencial interests in my life were always extreme sports.
      In particular, surfing. I first learned how to surf when I was just 6
      or 7 years old with my father at the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. I still
      remember catching small waves in a huge foam board and feeling like I was
      surfing 30 foot waves. The excitement and thrill has not faded since.
      Most importantly, though, surfing taught me to value respect for both other
      surfers (people) and for nature. There is no better feeling in the world
      other than going surfing with my dad, and I am blessed to be in a position
      where that is a possibility.</p>

    <p>Secondly, I have always loved music. Everyone has that moment when
        they close their eyes in the shower and see themselves singing in
        front of thousands of people. I am no different. My interest is mainly
        focus on classic rock. There is nothing AC/DC or Jim Croce cannot fix.
        If I wasn't tone death I wouldn't be here right now, most likely.
        My older brother is a musician and he always said we could've been
        the next Oasis. If I could actually perform, there would be no other
        career path I would follow.</p>

    <h2>Two Truths and One Lie</h2>

      <li>My family has over 26 animals</li>

    </ul>
